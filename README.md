Introduction
============

Epoxy Sequel is a fork of ProxySQL 1.4 without the dead code, ClickHouse, HTTP server and cruft.

The whole thing is reformatted with clang-format to the same standard as Percona Server, with the goal of soon successfully compiling with `-Werror`.

---

ProxySQL is a high performance, high availability, protocol aware proxy for MySQL and forks (like Percona Server and MariaDB).
All the while getting the unlimited freedom that comes with a GPL license.
